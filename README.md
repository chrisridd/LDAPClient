This is a library which allows an application on the Particle (n√©e Spark) Photon
to query an LDAP directory server.

## Usage

Create an `LDAPClient` object the same way you would create a `TCPClient` object:

```
LDAPClient client;
```

This doesn't do anything yet, so the next step is to connect to an LDAP server.
Currently only plaintext LDAP is supported due to a lack of SSL libraries on the
Photon:

```
client.connect(.....);
```

Note if you don't specify the final `port` parameter, it defaults to the LDAP
standard port of 389.

Now you are connected to the LDAP server. Initially you will have what LDAP calls
"anonymous" access, that is, you haven't authenticated to the server at all and
you can only access some information in the server. Maybe this is enough, but if
not, you can authenticate using this call:

```
client.bind("uid=xyz,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com", "password");
```

The first argument is the LDAP `DN` of the user you are authenticating as. It
looks like a string of `type=value` pairs separated by commas. See RFC 4512 and
RFC 4514 for the full details.

Note the `password` is sent to the LDAP server in the clear, due to no SSL. You
should not really use this over the wider Internet.

Finally, you can read information from the server. The first way simply "reads"
a given entry:

```
client.read("cn=Some Entry,ou=Somewhere Else,dc=example,dc=com");
```
